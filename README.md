**Please note that the models are not included in the project and Libraries such as GLFW, GLM, ImGUI, etc.**

**For the 3D Viewer to work correctly you will need:**

Note that there are 2 folders named "Resources"
- Resources folder (include libraries) placed in: current directory (next to Assessment)
- Create a Resources directory: Assessment/OpenGL/Resources
- Place the shaders and models folder inside the new Resources directory

**To simplify the process all the necessary folders are in this link:**
